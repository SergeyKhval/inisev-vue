# Some notes about the project

- I focused on logic, not design, since it's just a ppt file and I don't want to spend much time on it.
- If needed I can add animations to the drawer, but again I think it's out of scope for initial implementation
- I used default browser checkboxes
- I haven't made much refactoring, wanted to finish it quickly with all requirements implemented
